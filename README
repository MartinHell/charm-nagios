In order to monitor anything in your juju environment for working PING
and SSH, just relate the services to this service.

juju deploy nagios central-monitor
juju deploy mysql big-db
juju deploy statusnet microblog
juju add-reation big-db microblog
juju add-relation big-db central-monitor
juju add-relation mocroblog central-monitor

This should result in your Nagios monitoring all of the service units.

TODO:
- Add a nagios-nrpe subordinate charm to make it easier to use local
  plugins via NRPE
- Create a proper 'monitoring' interface that charms can use to define
  what they want monitored remotely.
