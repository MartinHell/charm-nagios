In order to monitor anything in your juju environment for working PING
and SSH, just relate the services to this service.

juju deploy nagios central-monitor
juju deploy mysql big-db
juju deploy statusnet microblog
juju add-reation big-db microblog
juju add-relation big-db central-monitor
juju add-relation mocroblog central-monitor

This should result in your Nagios monitoring all of the service units.

monitors interface
==================

The monitors interface expects three fields:

* monitors - YAML matching the monitors yaml spec. See
  example.monitors.yaml for more information.
* target-id - Assign any monitors to this target host definition.
* target-address - Optional, specifies the host of the target to
  monitor. This must be specified by at least one unit so that the
  intended target-id will be monitorable.

nrpe
====

There is an NRPE subordinate charm which must be used for any local
monitors.  See the 'nrpe' charm's README for information on how to
make use of it.
